### Esophageal Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for detecting esophageal cancer using machine learning models. With detailed data processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, it leverages a real-world esophageal cancer dataset to predict cancer status based on clinical and pathological features.

#### Key Components
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Utilizes a structured dataset containing patient details, pathology reports, and clinical indicators. Data loading is followed by initial exploration, including inspection of columns, data types, and summary statistics.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. Variables with high null percentages are systematically removed, and imbalanced classes are addressed using resampling techniques.

- **Feature Engineering**: Identifies significant features using chi-square analysis and correlation heatmaps. Features are grouped as categorical, discrete, and continuous, and irrelevant features are dropped to optimize model performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes distribution and relationships across features using histograms, box plots, and heatmaps. Analysis highlights trends in age, alcohol and smoking history, tumor location, and lymph node involvement, aiding in feature selection.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model tested for classification accuracy, precision, and recall.
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Provides improved accuracy with fine-tuned hyperparameters. Both models are evaluated through confusion matrices and classification reports, with a performance comparison.

- **Accuracy Comparison**: Confusion matrices and accuracy scores are visualized to compare model efficacy, highlighting the Decision Tree model as the better performing classifier.

#### Repository Structure
- **`data_loading_and_exploration.py`**: Script for loading and initially exploring the dataset.
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Contains functions for cleaning, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced data.
- **`eda.py`**: Generates visualizations and statistical analyses.
- **`model_training.py`**: Trains and evaluates Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
- **`model_evaluation.py`**: Visualizes model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
